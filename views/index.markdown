# William Barrett and Karen Chan

### Wedding Day: July 26, 2014 

### Wedding Venue: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada

Will and Karen have been together for six happy years. They met in 2006 at a chamber music sight-reading party (nerdy, we know) at the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore, Maryland. Karen asked Will if he would be her cellist for the next session, and it turned into a permanent arrangement. Since then they have moved to Chicago, picked up more degrees, changed careers, and through it all loved each other like crazy.

Karen Chan is the daughter of Tom and Kay Chan of Winchester, Massachussets.

William Barrett is the son of Ed Barrett of Lewiston, Maine and Cate Munch of Aptos, California.
